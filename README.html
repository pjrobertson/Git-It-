<h1 id="git_things">Git Things:</h1>

<p><strong>For anybody who&#8217;s interested</strong></p>

<p>==Git Basics==</p>

<p>First of all, you&#8217;ll want to clone your remote repository. To do this use</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@myPrivateGitURL
</code></pre>

<p>You can pull updates from that URL using</p>

<pre><code>git pull
</code></pre>

<p>or push commits using</p>

<pre><code>git push
</code></pre>

<p>Enough with the &#8216;basics&#8217; already!</p>

<p>==Resetting/Removing Your Changes==</p>

<p>To reset your local branch back to the remote branch (delete any local changes you&#8217;ve made), use</p>

<pre><code> git reset --hard
</code></pre>

<p>This is also really handy if you want to see where your local branch is at.
Typing this will tell you the last commit message, and you&#8217;ll be able to work from there.</p>

<p>If you want to go back one step i.e. <strong>undo</strong> a commit, use</p>

<pre><code>git reset HEAD~1
</code></pre>

<p>the number after the tidle ~ refers to how many commits you want to step back (one in the case above)</p>

<p>==Adding &amp; Getting Remote Commits==</p>

<p>To add a remote repository (e.g. someone elses)</p>

<pre><code> git remote add remoteName git://url
</code></pre>

<p>where remoteName is the name you want to give this person&#8217;s repository, and git://url is the URL for their repository</p>

<p>Then you&#8217;ll want to fetch info from that repository.
git fetch is like git pull, but doesn&#8217;t merge to any branch.
git pull is a git fetch followed by a git merge onto the current branch</p>

<pre><code>  git fetch remoteName
</code></pre>

<p>where remote name is the name of the remote repository you&#8217;ve just added in the previous command.</p>

<p>==Creating a Local Branch==</p>

<p>Now that the remote repository&#8217;s commits are on your computer, you&#8217;ll want to check out a branch of this remote repository</p>

<pre><code>git checkout -b someonesBranch remoteName/remoteBranch
</code></pre>

<p>where remoteBranch is the remote branch you want to look at and someonesBranch is the name you want to give your local copy of this branch</p>

<p>the -b basically says &#8220;you&#8217;ll need to make a new branch when checking this out&#8221;. It also ties the two together for future pulls/pushes</p>

<p>==Merging Branches==</p>

<p>You can now play with this branch, build, test etc.
If it&#8217;s good, and want to add it to the main branch, try</p>

<pre><code>  git checkout mainBranch
  git merge someonesBranch
</code></pre>

<p>where mainBranch would be <strong>your</strong> main, local branch (connected to your git repository)</p>

<p>==Cherry Picking Commits==</p>

<p>Note that git merge will add <strong>all</strong> the commits from someonesBranch to the main branch.
You may only want to add a few of the commits, if so you can &#8220;cherry-pick&#8221; which ones.
To avoid merge conflicts you must start with the earliest commit you want to add.</p>

<pre><code> git cherry-pick SHA-commitDate-01/01/2010
</code></pre>

<p>Which will add one commit.</p>

<p>Note that you need to be in the branch you want the commits pulling to. e.g. I want to add commits from someonesBranch to mainBranch, so I must</p>

<pre><code>git checkout mainBranch
</code></pre>

<p>first.
You can pull commits from anywhere as long as you have the commit SHA (long 2342ecf9d98edcdfe9987a987ef897d thing)</p>

<p>==Commit History</p>

<p>To see the commit history or what the SHA is for a specifiec commit, see github or type</p>

<pre><code>git log
</code></pre>

<p>on the branch you&#8217;re interested in. It&#8217;ll show you everything for as far back as you want
To get out of this just use CTRL + Z like on any terminal process</p>

<p>==Merge Conflicts==</p>

<p>If you get a warning about the automatic cherry-pick failing, then you have merge problems.
What this means is that the file(s) in question have changed between your branch (mainBranch) and the commit you&#8217;ve just cherry picked. That is, there&#8217;s a commit somewhere before 01/01/2010 that changes that file.
Use</p>

<pre><code>git status
</code></pre>

<p>to see what and where these conflicts lie.</p>

<p>If you want use a nice GUI to solve the merge conflicts</p>

<pre><code> git mergetool
</code></pre>

<p>will let you use FileMerge (Mac OS X) to see the difference between two files and select which one is the best for your final commit</p>

<p>==Pushing Back to Remote==</p>

<p>No problems? Solved that? You can cherry pick a commit from a later date now</p>

<pre><code>git cherry-pick SHA-commitDate-10/01/2010
</code></pre>

<p>as long as there are no merge problems ;)</p>

<p>Now pushing may also be a problem.
If you want to push to your remote repository remoteRepository, and more specifically to the branch remoteRepository/remoteBranch
BUT your local branch you&#8217;re going to push is not called the same thing as your remote branch, you&#8217;ll get an error on pushing.
What you need to do is</p>

<pre><code>git push remoteRepository localBranch:remoteBranch
</code></pre>

<p>This is saying &#8220;push to remoteRepository my local branch to the remote branch&#8221;</p>

<p>==Rebasing Commits==</p>

<p>If you do some silly things with your commits, like commit something wrong, or accidentally merge an already-merged commit, you will want to use</p>

<pre><code>git rebase -i SHA-1
</code></pre>

<p>the -i basically opens up your preferred editor and makes changing commits easier. The SHA-1 is the commit before the bad one (i.e. its parent)</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve done this, you can amend commits using</p>

<pre><code> git commit --amend
</code></pre>

<p>and finish the rebase using</p>

<pre><code> git rebase --continue
</code></pre>

<p>==Deleting Remote Branches==</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve pushed to a remote branch on your repository for testing or pull request purposes, and would like to delete the remote branch, use</p>

<pre><code>git push origin :nameOfBranchToDelete
</code></pre>
